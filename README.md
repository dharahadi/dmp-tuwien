# How does a country's development level correlate with the prevalence of mental health disorders over time?

## Description
This project investigates the correlation between a country's development level and the prevalence of mental health disorders in 2011. The analysis utilizes datasets from Kaggle, including Global Trends in Mental Health Disorders and World Development Indicators. The goal is to explore how economic and social development factors are associated with mental health outcomes across different countries. By comparing the data from developed and developing nations, this study aims to identify patterns that could provide valuable insights for global health policies and interventions. The analysis was conducted using Python and the Pandas library to clean, process, and analyze the data.

## Analysis  
The analysis focused on understanding the correlation between a country's development level and the prevalence of mental health disorders in 2011. The analysis was based on these steps:  

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:  
   - Missing data were identified and handled appropriately.  
   - Columns were renamed for clarity and consistency across both datasets.  
   - Relevant data were extracted for analysis.  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:  
   - Basic statistics were calculated to understand how the data is distributed.  
   - Plots and bar charts were created to explore patterns and relationships between variables.  

3. Comparison of Developed and Developing Countries:  
   - Countries were grouped into developed and developing categories based on World Development Indicators.  
   - The prevalence of mental health disorders was compared between these groups, focusing on it's biggest differences.  

The analysis was conducted using Python and the Pandas library, with additional support from Matplotlib for data visualization. Results indicate potential links between economic development and mental health outcomes, providing a foundation for further investigation.
